# Nonprofit Marketing Immersion
Pro bono account support from digital marketing students and volunteers around the world.

As a part of the Technologies for Web Marketing course offered at the Universit√† di Pisa taught by [Prof. Laura Pollacci](https://laurapollacci.github.io/), I have completed an online marketing challenge that is offered by Google as a part of the Nonprofit Marketing Immersion program.

The project has helped me to boost my digital marketing skills with real-world, hands-on experience by creating Ad Grants campaigns for a Nonprofit Organization (Pitman Animal Rescue Foundation).

In this repository, I shared the results we achieved. We tried adding great value to the efforts of the nonprofit organization which aims to reduce the number of dachshunds being euthanized in local shelters and provide well-educated and committed homes for homeless dogs. The organization is entirely run by volunteers passionate about animal welfare.
